# take a void

```
continuing a journey
one may discover a point
    with interest
    journey continue toward point
```

```
continuing the journey
the point may become a line
    eventually
        one may retrospect
        completing a cycle
    with interest
        one may repeat the cycle
            from beginig
            to now
        continuing the journey
```

/

```
using abstraction
    one may turn
    said line
    from beginig
    to now
    into a cycle
        with
        a point
        also beginig
        and point
        also now
        with line
            resulting in a circle
```

```
using said circle
    one may journey
    said journey
    however many cycle
```
